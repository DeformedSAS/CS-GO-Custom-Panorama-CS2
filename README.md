# Development has been continued.

# Custom panorama that looks like CS2's panorama for CS:GO.
This small project that i did for unknown reasons brings the CS2 ui look onto CS:GO

# NOTE: Always download the updated source code from the home page of the repo instead of the one from releases tab. 
# SECOND NOTE: Put the font files from the fonts folder from the code zip into the fonts folder of migi or csgo. depending if you have symlinks. This is required for the center navbar font aka the play button and other.

# Whole ui
- All of the core UI changes.

# Why aren't there more hud changes?
- There are.. just very minor such as the killfeed..
- Stuff like the deathpanel or killfeed are supposed to have a blurred background but for some reason.. It doesn't work the same way as for the alert..
- Hint Panel works albeit it for the picked up weapon panel it only works for the c4 and i am quite unsure why it does that.. i'll figure it out

# Main menu stuff changes
- At the launch of the game you will hear the CS2 intro logo, this is ignored if you have -novid.
- You will always hear the ambient sounds from the main menu in all panels except loading screen.
- Obviously the changes are visible on the first few screenshots.

# Inventory
- Well it wouldn't really be like cs2 if the inspecting stuff isn't like in CS2. So i added it!
