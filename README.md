# Custom panorama that looks like CS2's panorama for CS:GO.
This small project that i did for unknown reasons brings the CS2 ui look onto CS:GO

# NOTE: Always download the updated source code from the home page of the repo instead of the one from releases tab.

# Inventory
- Well it wouldn't really be like cs2 if the inspecting stuff isn't like in CS2. So i added it! PS: Knives cannot be inspected like guns, the reason for that is because valve messed up the center axis of all knife models in the game, for some reason they set the tip of all knives to be the center axis which makes no god damn sense.
