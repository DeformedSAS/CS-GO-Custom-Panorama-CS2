# Custom panorama that looks like CS2's panorama for CS:GO.
This small project that i did for unknown reasons brings the CS2 ui look onto CS:GO

# Main menu
Well since i don't really know js or css or xml i only did the basic stuff like change the agent position and stuff..

# Maps in the main menu should be possible since the engine supports that kind of stuff, but as i've said i don't know how to do it.


# News and Store
For now only the News is from CS2 as i couldn't get the Store to work at all. It only gave me a lot of JS errors in the console which didn't help a lot.


# That's it basically. If you know anything about CS:GO's ui modding could you help out please? If so contact me on Discord: deformedsas
