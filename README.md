CS2LikePanoramaForCSGO
This small project that i did for unknown reasons brings the CS2 ui look into CS:GO

There are some bugs here and there (Mostly in the pause menu for now as far as i'm aware) but overall is fully functional.


Hud
The hud remains unchanged unless i decide to add something like scaleform hud by Moi (https://github.com/MoiiCS/MoiHUD) (for now that would be aimed at a different project.)



Main menu
Well since i don't really know js or css or xml i only did the basic stuff like change the agent position and stuff..

Maps in the main menu should be possible since the engine supports that kind of stuff, but as i've said i don't know how to do it.


News and Store
For now only the Store is from CS2 as i couldn't get the Store to work at all. It only gave me a lot of JS errors in the console which didn't help a lot.



That's it basically. If you know anything about CS:GO's ui modding could you help out please? If so contact me on Discord: deformedsas
